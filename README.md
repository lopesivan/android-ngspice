# android-ngspice
ngspice working with the following additional apps from the google play store:
terminal-emulator, octave, droidplot and terminal-ide.

## 1) Description:

This is an Android port of ngspice, named "angspice" with a few slight changes
to ngspice's source code in order to get it to work.  It has been tested to
work alongside droidplot (gnuplot), octave and octave_spice to provide much of
the functionality of the regular ngspice on your PC/MAC (the extent of its
functionality has not been tested...).

## 2) Installation Instructions:

    a) Install terminal-ide from the google play store. Launch the app after installation and proceed to install the "system".
    b) Install terminal emlator from the google play store. This is needed to install octave and droidplot.
    c) Install octave from the google play store.
    d) Install droidplot (gnuplot) from the google play store.
